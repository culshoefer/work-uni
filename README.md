This repository is for the university files that are not relevant to the course anymore (i.e. no active coursework)

However, this repository does not contain *every single* code snippet I ever created in university (duh). In fact, it is only a small portion of the code I have written (to be honest, if I had only written 5'000 SLOC, I would be pretty ashamed)

As of now, this repository contains

1. some C things: Exam preparation and a bfs exercise

2. some Haskell things: Exam preparation, a fun game implementation (where I have not yet used proper types, but became comfortable with monads)

Have fun checking out the things!
