This repository is for the university files that are not relevant to the course anymore (i.e. no active coursework)

However, this repository does not contain *every single* code snippet I ever created in university (duh). In fact, it is only a small portion of the code I have written (to be honest, if I had only written 5'000 SLOC, I would be pretty ashamed)

As of now, this means for the most part

1. some C things

2. some Haskell things

Have fun checking out the things!
