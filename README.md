This repository is for these university files that I can make public because they are not relevant to the course anymore.
However, this repository does not contain *every single* code snippet I ever created in university.

As of now, this just means
1) some C things (to be honest, it is only a Breadth-First-Search exercise)
2) some Haskell things

Have fun checking out the things!
